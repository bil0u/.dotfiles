# Resources

Some of the resources I used for this project:

- [`plistwatch`](https://github.com/catilac/plistwatch) : awesome utility to detect defaults changes when modifying macos settings interactively
- [`prefsniff`](https://github.com/zcutlip/prefsniff) : similar as `plistwatch` but for observing directories or files
- [`defaults-edit`](https://github.com/ThatsJustCheesy/defaults-edit) : GUI app to explore and edit system defaults by domain
- [mathiasbyens's `.macos`](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/main/.macos) : a lot of defaults listed and organised in a bash script
