# Manual steps

Unfortunately, everything cannot be automatized, or at least is not worth it.

This file references a few things i do manually during the bootstrap process.

### 1Password

Before being able to use SSH keys in a convenient fashion, the following needs to be enabled:

- **Preferences**
  - **Security**
    - **Touch ID** : `Enabled` _(macOS w/ TouchID only)_
  - **Developer**
    - **Use SSH Agent**: `Enabled`
    - **1Password CLI 2**: `Enable biometric unlock` _(macOS w/ TouchID only)_
